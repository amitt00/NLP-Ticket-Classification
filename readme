Environment: A financial company wants to automate its customer support tickets system. 
             As a financial company, the firm has many products and services such as credit cards, banking and mortgages/loans. 

Buisness Objective: To build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services that the ticket mentions.
                    By doing so, one can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, 
                    therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.

Opted Methodology : 
           1) Apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into clusters based on their products/services.
           2) Coherence Model for optimum topics/clusters->(5)
           3) Map each ticket onto its respective department/category.
           4) Use this data to train supervised model( Naive Bayes/logistic regression/decision tree/random forest)
           5) Using trained model, classify new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department.

Result: Optimum result using Logistic Regression
